# CS 300 Portfolio Submission

## Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis
In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory efficiency of different data structures like vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. This helped me understand how each data structure performs and why choosing the right one is important for efficient software.

## Project Two: Sorting Courses
In Project Two, I wrote a program to sort and print a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order. This project helped me practice sorting algorithms and working with data structures in real-world applications.

## Reflections

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was to understand and implement efficient data structures and algorithms to manage and display course information for a Computer Science program.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by first learning about different data structures and their strengths and weaknesses. Data structures are important because they help organize and manage data efficiently, which is critical for building fast and scalable software.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I faced challenges like debugging sorting algorithms and handling file input. I overcame these by breaking the problem into smaller parts, testing each part individually, and using online resources and documentation to find solutions.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project taught me to think more about efficiency and scalability when designing software. I now consider how data structures and algorithms impact performance and try to choose the best tools for the job.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Iâ€™ve started writing cleaner and more modular code, using meaningful variable names, and adding comments to explain my logic. This makes my code easier to read, maintain, and adapt for future projects.
